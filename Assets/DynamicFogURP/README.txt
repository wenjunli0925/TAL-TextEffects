Requirements
------------
Dynamic Fog & Mist 2 currently works only with Universal Rendering Pipeline (v7.1.8 or later)
Make sure you have Universal RP package imported in the project before using Dynamic Fog & Mist 2.


Demo Scenes
-----------
There's a demo scene which lets you quickly check if Dynamic Fog & Mist 2 is working correctly in your project.
Note: make sure you have Universal RP 7.2.0 or later installed from Package Manager and also a URP pipeline asset assigned to Graphics Settings.


Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains instructions on how to use this asset as well as a useful Frequent Asked Question section.


Support
-------
Please read the documentation PDF and browse/play with the demo scenes and sample source code included before contacting us for support :-)

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Dynamic Fog & Mist will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
